# KeyAuth-Stats-Example
This example will allow you to get the following amounts from keyauth: applications, accounts, licenses, uptime. This is the totals for KeyAuth... not your application. 


You can change this however you like. It's really easy to setup, and you can add a timer to grab automatically, or whatever you want to do...
